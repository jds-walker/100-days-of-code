### Day 1: 12 March, 2020 

**Agile Update:** 

What I did yesterday:
* Decided to undertake the 100 days of code challenge and setup base repo

What I will do today:
* Initialise a react app with AWS Amplify and attempt to set up federated access with [Xero](https://xero.com)


What blockers do I have:
* I've tried doing some of this before and often get stuck in the detail, looking forward to making progress this time.

**Thoughts:**
Struggled more with setting up the federated access than I would like.
