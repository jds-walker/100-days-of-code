### Day 4: 15 March, 2020
What I did yesterday:
* Struggled a little with authentication but went back and fixed it up after my 1 hour of 100 days of code, pleased with this perserverence.

What I will do today:
* Will look at react-router and see about adding some routing to the website.


What blockers do I have:
* None currently, federated access isn't working at this stage but will get back to it at some point.

### Day 3: 14 March, 2020 

**Agile Update:** 

What I did yesterday:
* Added material-ui to the project

What I will do today:

What blockers do I have:

### Day 2: 13 March, 2020 

**Agile Update:** 

What I did yesterday:
* Basic CRA setup with an initialised Amplify project. Attempted to federate access with Xero.

What I will do today:
* Take a break from federated access since it was a blocker and add some styles to the base website using Material Design.


What blockers do I have:
* struggling with federated access.

### Day 1: 12 March, 2020 

**Agile Update:** 

What I did yesterday:
* Decided to undertake the 100 days of code challenge and setup base repo

What I will do today:
* Initialise a react app with AWS Amplify and attempt to set up federated access with [Xero](https://xero.com)


What blockers do I have:
* I've tried doing some of this before and often get stuck in the detail, looking forward to making progress this time.

**Thoughts:**
Struggled more with setting up the federated access than I would like.
